# DOSATTACKUSINGNS2
MY NAME IS THELLAMEKALA REDDY PRAKASH.
I AM INTERESTED IN LEARNING NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND MAKING THEM UTILIZED WHENEVER THEY NEED IN SOLVING PROBLEMS.
CURRENTLY I HAD DONE A PROJECT ON DOS ATTACKING USING NETWORK SIMULATION VERSION 2 AND IT IS UNDER THE DOMAIN OF CYBER SECURITY.
THIS PROJECT HELPS ME IN PROTECTING MYSELF FROM THE CYBER ATTACKS AND TO HELP FOR THE ORGANISATIONS WHERE I WOULD LIKE WORK TOO.
THIS IS ABOUT ME.
